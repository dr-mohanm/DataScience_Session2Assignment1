# 1. Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list

# Accept input from user in the console using input function, split it by comma and store in the variable L.
# print it using list format.

L = input('Enter numbers with commas delimiter').split(',')

# 2.  Create the below pattern using nested for loop in Python. 
#         *  
#         * *

#         * * * *

#         *

# Declare a variable and assign value as 5. since we need the maximum of 5 stars.
# First for loop in the Top Pattern iterates i for 5 times in incremental order and the inner for loop executes multiple times
# based on the i value.Bottom Pattern decrement by 1 until end of loop.


X = 5;
# TOP Pattern
for i in range(0,X):
    for j in range(0,i):

# Bottom pattern
for i in range(X,0,-1):
    for j in range(0,i):
        print('* ', end="")
